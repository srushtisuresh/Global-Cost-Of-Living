# Global-Cost-Of-Living
Being a data enthusiast, I am a member of multiple data groups on linkedin. I have come across various visualizations
on the same dataset and have been caught by surprise everytime I look at the conclusions. I believe the difference in the conclusion coming from the same
dataset that everyone is using is from the level of data cleaning. I went ahead and tried to clean the data myself and concluded on how accurate these
visualizations are based on facts and numbers.
